## 📊 Overview  

Camera Raw is a specialized image processing engine designed to unlock the full potential of RAW photography. Built for photographers who need complete control over tonal range, color accuracy, and image clarity, it converts raw sensor data into refined, high-quality visuals while maintaining the flexibility of non-destructive editing.

The engine reads RAW formats from a wide variety of cameras and provides detailed sliders for exposure, white balance, tonal curves, dynamic range recovery, and contrast refinement. Adjustments preserve highlight detail, lift shadows cleanly, and maintain natural color transitions. This ensures that every edit retains the maximum possible visual information from the original capture.

Camera Raw also includes an extensive suite for color manipulation. Photographers can fine-tune hue, saturation, and luminance for individual color ranges, correct unwanted color shifts, and shape the overall mood through advanced grading tools. Lens correction profiles help automatically fix distortion, vignetting, and chromatic aberration based on the camera–lens combination detected.

Detail enhancement tools offer refined control over texture, clarity, sharpness, and noise reduction. These features allow users to bring out micro-details while smoothing out unwanted grain in low-light images. The engine’s masking and local adjustment tools enable selective edits using brushes, radial masks, linear gradients, and AI-driven selections that automatically isolate subjects, skies, or backgrounds.

Camera Raw integrates seamlessly with Photoshop and Lightroom, making it a central part of many professional imaging workflows. It serves as the RAW adjustment stage before moving into more advanced compositing or catalog-based management. Export options allow users to output processed photos in various color spaces and resolutions tailored for print, web, or retouching pipelines.

With its balance of precision, speed, and modern enhancement tools, Camera Raw remains a core solution for photographers who want full control over how their images come to life.
